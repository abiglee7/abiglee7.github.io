- **May 2025:** I defended my PhD and became Dr. Lee!

- **March 2025:** Our [JWST Cycle 4 Treasury program](https://www.stsci.edu/jwst/science-execution/program-information?id=7763) (PI: D. Weisz, Co-PI: A. Lee) was approved by the TAC! We are going to observe 80 galaxies in the Virgo cluster to better understand galaxy cluster evolution along with exploring many other scientific applications. 

- **February 2023:** I accepted a four-year postdoctoral position in the department of Astronomy UC Berkeley! I will be a [NHFP Hubble Fellow](https://www.stsci.edu/stsci-research/fellowships/nasa-hubble-fellowship-program/2025-nhfp-fellows) from 2025-2026 and a [Miller Fellow](https://miller.berkeley.edu/fellowship/awards) from 2026-2029.

- **October 2024:** We submitted a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09256) demonstrating robust star formation histories up to 8 Gyr can be measured using only AGB stars. 

- **August 2024:** We submitted a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03474) measuring the Hubble constant using a new standard candle, the JAGB method. This paper was covered by [Quanta](https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-webb-telescope-further-deepens-the-biggest-controversy-in-cosmology-20240813/). You can find an interview of me talking about this paper on the YouTube channel [Cosmology Talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpSsmyInrEA&t=1262s)!

- **June 2024:** I attended the [XIV Torino Workshop on AGB Stars](https://indico.ict.inaf.it/event/2523/page/1335-prize-for-young-researchers) in Frascati, Italy, and was awarded the [AGB stars Prize for young researchers](https://indico.ict.inaf.it/event/2523/page/1335-prize-for-young-researchers)!
