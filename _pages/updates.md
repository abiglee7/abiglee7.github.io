- **August 2024:** We submitted a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03474) measuring the Hubble constant using a new standard candle, the JAGB method. This paper was covered by [Quanta](https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-webb-telescope-further-deepens-the-biggest-controversy-in-cosmology-20240813/). You can find an interview of me talking about this paper on the YouTube channel [Cosmology Talks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpSsmyInrEA&t=1262s)!

- **June 2024:** I attended the [XIV Torino Workshop on AGB Stars](https://indico.ict.inaf.it/event/2523/page/1335-prize-for-young-researchers) in Frascati, Italy, and was awarded the [AGB stars Prize for young researchers](https://indico.ict.inaf.it/event/2523/page/1335-prize-for-young-researchers)!
