My CV can be downloaded [Here](../files/CV_2020 (4).pdf) (last updated June 2025). 

Education
======
* Ph.D. in Astronomy & Astrophysics, University of Chicago, 2025. You can find a copy of my dissertation and all its acknowledgements [here](https://knowledge.uchicago.edu/record/15515?v=pdf). Note that I took advantage of UChicago Astro's very nice rule that allows graduate students to re-publish single-author papers as their thesis in lieu of a full dissertation ðŸ˜Š
* B.A. in Physics, University of Pennsylvania, summa cum laude, 2019
