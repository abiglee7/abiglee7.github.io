I'm an [NHFP Hubble](https://www.stsci.edu/stsci-research/fellowships/nasa-hubble-fellowship-program/2025-nhfp-fellows) and [Miller](https://miller.berkeley.edu/fellowship/awards) fellow at UC Berkeley in the Department of Astronomy. My thesis research focused on developing a new high-precision standard candle, the JAGB method, to measure the Hubble constant. I am also interested in building new techniques to reconstruct the evolutionary histories of galaxies using their stellar populations.
