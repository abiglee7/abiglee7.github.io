I'm a finishing Ph.D. student in the UChicago Department of [Astronomy & Astrophysics](https://astrophysics.uchicago.edu/), working with Professor Wendy Freedman. My thesis focued on developing a new high-precision standard candle, the JAGB method, to measure the Hubble constant. I am also interested in building new techniques to reconstruct the evolutionary histories of galaxies from their stellar populations.
