I'm an [NHFP Hubble](https://www.stsci.edu/stsci-research/fellowships/nasa-hubble-fellowship-program/2025-nhfp-fellows) and [Miller](https://miller.berkeley.edu/fellowship/awards) fellow at UC Berkeley in the Department of Astronomy. I am currently interested in using NIR observations of resolved stellar populations to learn about galaxy evolution and the extragalactic distance scale.
